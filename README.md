## Hi , I'm Ahmed Elemary
### Undergraduate Computer and Systems Engineering at Alexandria University.
I worked on a lot of projects during my university journey and still working on myself.

Passion for problem-solving and making the code as clean as possible by correct naming and applying design patterns.

Making use of the best data structure to save time and storage makes me happy :)
